BIO
======
I am a senior student major in Mathematics and Statistics at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Martin Strauss](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/) through a REU program on NLP and Algorithmic Fairness. I also worked with [Dr. Ranjan Pal](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/ranjanswebspace/home) on Cyber Risk and Computational Complexity. I was a member at [Lab of Geometry at UM](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/LoGM.html), working with [Lab of Geometry at UM](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/LoGM.html) on the explicit computations of simplicial and cosimplicial complex. Prior to UMich, I was an undergraduate student at Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in rural Ohio. I was honored to work with [Prof. Nuh Aydin](https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Math/Aydin/) on Algebraic Coding Theory.

In general, I'm interested in questions raised in pure mathematics and machine learning. My recent research interests are: 
1. Various learning theory
2. Coding Theory from aspects of mathematics and machine learning
